Suppose that university wants to show off how politically correct it is by applying the U.S. Supreme Court’s “Separate but equal is inherently unequal”
 doctrine to gender as well as race, ending its long-standing practice of gender-segregated bathrooms on campus. However, as a concession to tradition, it decrees 
 that when a woman is in a bathroom, other woman may enter, but no men, and vice versa. A sign with a sliding marker on the door of each bathroom indicates which
 of three possible states it is currently in:
q  Empty

q  Woman present

q  Men present
In some programming language you like, write the following procedures: woman_wants_to_enter (), man_wants_to_enter (), woman_leaves (), man_leaves ().

 Simple Solution

// 3 states occupied 0 = empty, occupied 1 = men, occupied -1 = female.

int occupied = 0; 
int numb = 0;

woman_wants_to_enter (){
	while(occupied > 0  ); //wait indefinitly
	occupied = -1;
	numb = numb ++;
}

man_wants_to_enter (){
	while (occupied < 0 ); // wait indefintly 
	occupied =1;
	numb = numb ++;
}

woman_leaves (){
	numb --;
	if(numb == 0) occupied = 0;
}

man_leaves ().{
	numb --;
	if(numb == 0) occupied = 0;
}



Solution ending starvation 

// 3 states occupied 0 = empty, occupied 1 = men, occupied -1 = female.
// lets assume n to be 5, after 5 people went to the bathroom it can be used by another gender
int occupied = 0; 
int numb = 0;
int n = 0;

//If occupied is greater than 0 then it will wait and also increment number of wommen and varaaible n to keep track of how many wommen have already gone 
woman_wants_to_enter (){
	while(occupied > 0 ); //wait indefinitly
	occupied = -1;
	numb = numb ++;
	n++;
}
//If occupied is less than 0 then it will wait and also increment number of men and varaaible n to keep track of how many men have already gone 
man_wants_to_enter (){
	while (occupied < 0 ); // wait indefintly 
	occupied =1;
	numb = numb ++;
	n++;
}

// If n =5 then it will automatically switch it to men so no starvation 
// if numb of men = 0; then it will turn it to 0 so that anybody can use it next 
woman_leaves (){
	numb --;
	if(n >=5){
		occupied = 1;
		n = 0;
	}
	if(numb == 0) {
	occupied = 0;
	}
}

// If n =5 then it will automatically switch it to women so no starvation 
// if numb of men = 0; then it will turn it to 0 so that anybody can use it next 
man_leaves ().{ 
	numb --;
		if(n >=5){
		occupied = -1; 
		n = 0;
	}
	if(numb == 0) occupied = 0;
}
