Computer System Operation
	I/O structure
	
Computer system operation:
	I/o and CPU can execute concurently 
	each device controler is incharge of a particular device 
	each device has its own buffer 
	CPU moves data from main memory to/from local buffer 
 	Device controller informs the CPU that it has finished its operation by 
	raising an interrupt

	Something about a n interrupt vector 
	Operating system is interrupt driven 

	A trap is a software generated interrupt caused either by error
	or user request 

	Interrupt Handling 
	The os preserves the state of the CPU by storing the registers and 
	the program counter on the stack 
	
	
	two types polling and vectored interrupt system 
	
	Vectored interrupt is an I/O interrupt that tells the part of
	the computer that handles I/O interrupts at the hardware level 
	that requests for attention and also identifies the device that 
	sent the request.

	Polling Interrupt constantly asks each device in to see if they 
	requested an interrupt 

	
	Synchronous Blocking
	after I/O interrupt start control returns to the program only after I/O 
	complettion
	
	Asynchronous Blocking:
	happens simulataniously 


	Starage Structure:
	Main Storage is volatile and random access
	
	Secondary Storage
	non Volatile 
	
	Magnetic Disks
	Solid State Disk


Hardware protection 
	Dual mode 
	I/O protetion
	Memory Protectionon
	CPU protection

	Dual mode- 2 modes User mode and kernel mode 
	I/O Protection - Priviledged Instruction 
	Memory Protection - Base register and Limit register 
	CPU Protection  - Timer interrupts computer after specified period to ensure
	OS maintains control 
	Privelidged instruction 

How are Systems organized ?
	simple  - one or two layers
	Layered - one on top of the other each one is independent 
	MicroKernel - Many user level process 
	Modular - Dynamically loadable modeules

	Hardware
	Cpu scheduling 
	I/O
	Virtual memory 
	Device driver and scheduler 
	Interface Primitives 
	User programs
