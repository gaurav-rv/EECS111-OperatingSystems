Main memory 
	binding of instructions can happen at 3 different stages 
		1. Compile time 
		2.Load time
		3.Execution time
		
	Backing store:
		A process is removed from the main memory and stored in this space 
		and brought back when needed to execute 
		
	Main memory usualy into 2 parts 
		Resident operating system - low memory 
		User process high memory 
		Limit and base register
		
	Fragmentaiton can be avoided by compaction 	
		Done at execution time 
		
	Segmentation 
		Breaking up a program into several parts 
		and then storing the parts
	
	Segmentation Architecture 
		<segmentation number , offset>
	
	Paging 
		physical address space of a process can be non contigious 
		avoids external fragmentation 
		
	Divides physical memory into frames 
	each frame is of the same size called virtual paging 
	page table will help convert logical into physical address
